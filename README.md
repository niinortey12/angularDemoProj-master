# AngularDemoProj

This is a simple angular project which takes clients data from a json file to display in a list. It also has an edit button functionality which prefills an edit form with client data based on client id.

# Project Goals

* Objective is to develop a form component, which opens once you click on the Edit button
* Set ID in the route and use it to prefill the form
* On submission of the form, simply show a modal pop-up indicating a success that details have changed. You don't have to actually
  change anything.
* Cancel button click should just take you back to the list.
* Validations are done as soon as user focuses away from input
* Cover unit tests required for the new components
  Feel free to improve the project wherever you feel like.
